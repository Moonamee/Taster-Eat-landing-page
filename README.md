# JavaScript
The code performs the following functions:</p>

1. AOS.init(); - initializes the AOS (Animate On
Scroll) library, which adds animation to
elements as the page scrolls.

2. Burger menu: - Clicking on an element with
class "mobile div" adds/removes "active", "open"
and "show" class from corresponding elements
with classes "mobileDiv", "mobileNav" and
"mobileNavUl". This allows the burger menu to be
displayed and hidden when clicked. - When
clicking outside the area with class "mobile",
the classes "active", "open" and "show" of
elements with classes "mobileDiv", "mobileNav"
and "mobileNavUl" are removed. This allows the
burger menu to be hidden when clicked outside
its area. - For each list item with the "mobile
ul li" class, an animation delay is set using
the "animationDelay" property.

3. accordion: - Gets all elements with class
"accordion" and adds a "click" event handler for
each element. - When an accordion element is
clicked, it toggles the "active" class and
changes the display style of the next element
(panel). If the display style is set as "flex",
it changes to "none", and vice versa. This code
is responsible for the burger menu and accordion
functionality on the web page.
